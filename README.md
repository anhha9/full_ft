# Further prototyping for fine-tuning
This repository contains the first version of the code used for fine-tuning FLAN-T5-small on the Sproat and Jaitly's (2017) Google Text Normalization dataset. 

Problems when running on University of Edinburgh's GPU with this code: CUDA OutOfMemory error. 

The final and working code is in full_ft_tn repo.
